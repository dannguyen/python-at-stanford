# Python Courses at Stanford 

A curated list of Stanford University courses that use Python in the curriculum. Inspired by the Stanford University Libraries Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research's curated list of courses that use R: [sul-cidr/RCatS](https://github.com/sul-cidr/RCatS)

Just a short list of the things [Dan Nguyen](http://stanford.edu/~dun/) could think off of the top of his head. Will write Github/syllabus scraper later.
